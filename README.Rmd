Courtr is a tool designed to assist with courtroom studies. 
It provides customizable figures and a study template using R Shiny, which includes a recordable notepad for participant notes, as well as color-coded speech bubbles.

Thank you to Richy Meleus for developing the cartoon figures used in this app.

## Installation

You can install the development version of courtr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rachelesrogers/courtr")
```

## Getting Started

We recommend to start by using the `Save_Template()` function to save the study template to your device.
The README.txt file in the study template provides detailed instructions on how to customize the R Shiny application.
To get an idea of what the study format looks like, you can run the template without any modifications.

```{r}
library(courtr)

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Save_Template("your/file/path")
```

The testimony page of the app will look like this:
<img src="man/figures/template_screenshot.png" align="center" alt="template screenshot" />

Insert your own testimony into the "Combined_Testimony.csv" file. Then, use the `Format_Testimony()` to format the testimony with the appropriate tags necessary for creating the visual output. 
Save this formatted file as "Combined_Testimony_Formatted.csv" in your downloaded template.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

unformatted_testimony <- utils::read.csv("your/file/path/Combined_Testimony.csv")
formatted_testimony <- Format_Testimony(unformatted_testimony)

write.csv(formatted_testimony, "your/file/path/Combined_Testimony_Formatted.csv")
```

The characters used in the study can also be customized using the `Edit_Figures()` function.
This function will pull up an R Shiny app, allowing for customization of provided figures.
The figures can be downloaded and saved in "your/file/path/www" to be used in your study.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Edit_Figures()
```
